# Screenshots for Mockups:

The mockups below are created using the Justinmind wire-framing tool. I chose to use this tool because:
* It allows me as a designer to create both low- and high-fidelity prototypes, and I'm able to get pretty
  in depth with prototyping interactions as well.
* It seems really straightforward to set up designs as mockups.It is the easiest prototyping program to use and learn.
* User Interface is great and you can easily create an interactive prototype of your app
* I like the intuitive way the software presents its resources, in particular, the graphics resources, on the left sidebar.
* It offers capabilities typically found in diagramming tools like drag and drop placement, re-sizing, formatting and export/import of widgets.
